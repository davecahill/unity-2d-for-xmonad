Compiling unity-qt
==================

cmake . && make


Running separate components

cd launcher && ./app/unity-qt-launcher
cd panel && ./app/unity-qt-panel
cd places && ./app/unity-qt-places


Notes on the dash (places)
==========================

In order to try out the dash fully one should not have any application
managing the desktop running. In order to stop nautilus from managing the
desktop, the following GConf key has to be set to false:

gconftool-2 -s /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop -t bool false


The dash exposes 2 D-Bus methods for activation and deactivation:

com.canonical.UnityQt /dash local.LauncherDeclarativeView.activate
com.canonical.UnityQt /dash local.LauncherDeclarativeView.deactivate
