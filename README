Compiling unity-2d
==================

cmake . && make


Running separate components
===========================

./launcher/app/unity-2d-launcher
./panel/app/unity-2d-panel
./places/app/unity-2d-places


Notes on the dash (places)
==========================

In order to try out the dash fully one should not have any application
managing the desktop running. In order to stop nautilus from managing the
desktop, the following GConf key has to be set to false:

gconftool-2 -s /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop -t bool false


The dash exposes a D-Bus property for activation and deactivation:

com.canonical.Unity2d /dash local.DashDeclarativeView.active true|false
