To build trunk:

 1. Install build dependencies (on Ubuntu):

  apt-get build-dep unity-2d

 2. Qt/QML preprocessing/preparation stage:

  cmake .

 3. Compile (in parallel on four CPUs):

  make -j4

 4. Test:

  killall -9 unity-2d
  ./shell/app/unity-2d-shell &

 5. Test again with non-compositing window-manager mode (eg. different assets
  such as './shell/common/artwork/desktop_dash_background_no_transparency.sci'):
  
  gconftool-2 --set --type=bool /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager false
  killall metacity
  killall -9 unity-2d
  ./shell/app/unity-2d-shell &

 6. Restore compositing mode:

  gconftool-2 --set --type=bool /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager false
  killall metacity
  killall -9 unity-2d
  ./shell/app/unity-2d-shell &
