/* To be able to call grabMouse() we need to be 100% sure that X11 did

   confusingly incorrectly reports the widget to be the mouseGrabber())

   Grabbing the mouse just after calling show() on the wiew
   will not work, since the window is really not visible yet.

   One would expect showEvent to be a good candidate, but it doesn't
   work either. According to the docs of QWidget::showEvent the window is
   really shown only when the event's spontaneous() flag is true, however we
   never seem to receive showEvents with this flag set to true.

   The first time the window seems to be actually visible is in focusEvent.

       input, then the viewport doesn't receive these events anymore and the
       mouse stops working.
