/*
Each SpreadWindow represents a real window on the desktop (we are
passed a WindowInfo object with all the information about it).

Its state ("" or "spread") decides which mode the window should
follow to position itself on screen ("screen" or "spread" mode
respectively).

In screen mode we use the real window's position and size to exactly mimic it.

In spread mode, we are assigned a cell in the spread, and we resize
and reposition ourselves to be fully constrained and centered inside
that specific cell.
The shot should occupy as much space as possible inside the cell,
but never be bigger than its original window's size, and always
maintain the same aspect ratio as the original window.

               the text itself, with 3 pixels of margin on all sides, but it should also
               never overflow the shot's borders.

               Normally one would just set anchors.margins, but this can't work
               here because first we need to let the Text calculate it's "natural" width
               ("paintedWidth" in QT terms) -- that is, the size it would have
               Ã¬f free to expand horizontally unconstrained, to know if it's smaller than
               the labelBox or not.
               However if we bind the Text's width to the width of the labelBox, and the
               width of the labelBox to the Text's size, we get a binding loop error.

               The trick is to bind the Text's width to the labelBox's parent, and then
               the labelBox to the Text's size. Since the relation between labelBox and
               parent is taken care of by the positioner indirectly, there's no loop.

               Yeah, messy. Blame QML ;)
