/*
Each SpreadItem represents a real window on the desktop (we are
passed a WindowInfo object with all the information about it).

Its state ("" or "spread") decides which mode the item should
follow to position itself on screen ("screen" or "spread" mode
respectively). The state is the same as state of the whole grid.

In screen mode we does just use the real window's position and size
to exactly mimic it.

In grid mode, we are assigned a cell in the grid, and we resize
and reposition ourselves to be fully constrained and centered inside
that specific cell.
The shot should occupy as much space as possible inside the cell,
but never be bigger than its original window's size, and always
maintain the same aspect ratio as the original window.

Please note that a big chunk of the size calculations are taking place
in the states property, at the bottom of this file.

               Normally one would just set anchors.margins, but this can't work
               here because first we need to let the Text calculate it's "natural" width
               ("paintedWidth" in QT terms) -- that is, the size it would have
               Ã¬f free to expand horizontally unconstrained, to know if it's smaller than
               the labelBox or not.
               However if we bind the Text's width to the width of the labelBox, and the
               width of the labelBox to the Text's size, we get a binding loop error.

               The trick is to bind the Text's width to the labelBox's parent, and then
               the labelBox to the Text's size. Since the relation between labelBox and
               parent is taken care of by the positioner indirectly, there's no loop.

               Yeah, messy. Blame QML ;)
