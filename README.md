Changes from standard unity-2d
============================

* Display both application name and window title in panel
* Move launcher under panel so it doesn't cover it
* Load panel only on the primary screen
* Don't filter apps in lagacy tray
* Changed spread(aplication and workspace switcher) behaviour so it's useful in xmonad.
* Simplified spred layout and animations so it works much faster
