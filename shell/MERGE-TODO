To obtain a full upstreamable merge of dash and launcher that mantains the full
feature set currently available we need to take care of the following tasks:

* Add cmd line option to choose which root QML file to load
* Add proper package transition for launcher and dash in debian/rules
* Actually merge the launcher into the shell

* Put back in support for RTL
* Move updateDashModeDependingOnScreenGeometry to QML
