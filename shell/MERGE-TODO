To obtain a full upstreamable merge of dash and launcher that mantains the full
feature set currently available we need to take care of the following tasks (ordered by severity):

= High =

* The panel now has window buttons to close, minimize, maximize the dash. Make these work with the shell and remove the
  bottom-right maximize button we have now.
* Add back this Launcher feature: when alt+f1 is pressed and launcher already has focus, the shell window should be deactivated
  so the WM will give focus back to whatever window had it before.
* Put back Super+D to show desktop. Also make sure the behaviour from r.808 from trunk is implemented (display launcher when
  desktop is showing).

= Medium =

* Merge review 803 from lp:unity-2d ([launcher] Do not hide the launcher immediately after removing an icon. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/884410. Reviewed by Tiago Salem Herrmann.)
* Add proper package transition from unity-2d-launcher+unity-2d-places to unity-2d-shell in debian/rules
* Put back in support for RTL
* Add cmd line option to choose which root QML file to load
* Put back support for struts and enable struts automatically when hide-mode is always visible
  (the dconf setting was already removed by partially merging revision 804 from trunk)
* Put back in support for 4-finger slide gesture (in a way that's not tied to the panel)
  - Put back support for launcher manualSliding
  - Implement locking in place when the slide goes over 240 units (check in unity-3d what should happen in the various hide modes) 
* We are doing IPC between components in the same process in various cases. This brings back
  bad memories and should be removed.

= Minor =

* Remove the LauncherClient as it's now just an empty class
* Tests were removed, we need to put them back.
  * We both need to put back the regular tests and the code in the CMakeLists.txt for the UI tests (see rev 831 from trunk)
* Move updateDashModeDependingOnScreenGeometry to QML
* Fix .bzrignore
