To obtain a full upstreamable merge of dash and launcher that mantains the full
feature set currently available we need to take care of the following tasks (ordered by severity):

= High =

* Shell window should be input-shaped so that the part that belongs to neither dash nor launcher does not receive input
* Clicking on the panel or inactive parts of the launcher does not make the dash lose focus (and thus disappear)
* Correctly register shell as Launcher over DBUS
* Make launcher hide modes work with the shell. Right now launcher is always visible.
* Laucher was a dock window, now it's a regular window. Experiment with making it dock again or at least always-on-top


= Medium =

* Add proper package transition from unity-2d-launcher+unity-2d-places to unity-2d-shell in debian/rules
* Put back in support for RTL
* Add cmd line option to choose which root QML file to load

= Minor =

* The BFB button in launcher activates the dash through dbus, but it can be done more efficiently in some more direct way (signals ?)
* Tests were removed
* Move updateDashModeDependingOnScreenGeometry to QML
