To obtain a full upstreamable merge of dash and launcher that mantains the full
feature set currently available we need to take care of the following tasks (ordered by severity):

= High =

* Shell window should be input-shaped so that the part that belongs to neither dash nor launcher does not receive input
  - This should also work correctly with the dash bottom-right corner which is already input shaped.
* Correctly register shell as Launcher over DBUS
* Make ALT+F1 and keyboard operation for the launcher work again

= Medium =

* Add proper package transition from unity-2d-launcher+unity-2d-places to unity-2d-shell in debian/rules
* Put back in support for RTL
* Add cmd line option to choose which root QML file to load
* Put back in support for 4-finger slide gesture (in a way that's not tied to the panel)
  - Put back support for struts
  - Put back support for launcher manualSliding
  - Implement locking in place when the slide goes over 240 units (check in unity-3d what should happen in the various hide modes) 
* We are doing IPC between components in the same process in various cases. This brings back
  bad memories and should be removed.

= Minor =

* Tests were removed, do we need to put them back ?
* Move updateDashModeDependingOnScreenGeometry to QML
