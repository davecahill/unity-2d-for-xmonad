=XDo
XDo is a library to simulate keyboard and mouse input and manipulating windows on the X server. 
It's wrapped around the command-line tools xdotool[http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/], 
xsel[http://linux.die.net/man/1/xsel], xwininfo[http://linux.die.net/man/1/xwininfo], eject[http://linux.die.net/man/1/eject] and xkill[http://linux.die.net/man/1/xkill], 
so you will need to have them installed if you want to use Xdo (even if xwininfo, eject and xkill are usually already installed). 
If not, try to install them via your favourite packaging manager. 
After they're installed, install XDo via RubyGems: 
  sudo gem install xdo
==Usage
  #Require some of XDo's files
  require "xdo/keyboard"
  require "xdo/mouse"
  require "xdo/xwindow"
  #Move the cursor
  XDo::Mouse.move(100, 100)
  #Simulate text (with special escape sequences!)
  XDo::Keyboard.simulate("This is{TAB}text.")
  #Some sequences can be shortened: 
  XDo::Keyboard.simulate("This ist\ttext.")
  #And this will move a window containing the string "gedit", 
  #unless it's maximized. 
  win = XDo::XWindow.from_title(/gedit/)
  win.move(200, 200)
==Files
You can require the following files in your projects: 
* xdo/clipboard: Clipboard access
* xdo/keyboard: Pretty self-explaining
* xdo/mouse: Automate the mouse
* xdo/xwindow: Manipulate windows in various ways
As an helpful extra, I created an executable ruby file "xinfo.rb". Thanks to RubyGems, 
you can start this GUI tool right from the command line by typing: 
  xinfo.rb
It's by far not perfect, maybe not even good, but I think it can be useful sometimes 
(you will need to have wxRuby installed, try <tt>sudo gem install wxruby-ruby19</tt>). 
If you're looking for a more professional program, try the "X window information" tool. 
==Notes
* If your +xdotool+ seems to reject the --window option, you are not using the current version. Try building the newest one from the source. 
* I recommand the "X window information" tool to get infos about your windows if you aren't satisfied by the xinfo.rb shipped with this package. 
==Fairly incomplete
* I'm sure there are several things I didn't notice that can be automated somehow. If you know about, email me! Please add a description of the possibilities and a sample script. 
* Another interesting thing are the samples. There are many Linux distrubitions out there, and even many of them rely on X. I cannot test with another than a recent Ubuntu machine, but if you want to contribute and send samples for another OS, I want to encourage you to - I surely won't reject your work. :-)
